Key Variables
minSoFar: Tracks the minimum price encountered so far as we iterate through the array

maxProfit: Stores the maximum profit we can achieve

Algorithm Steps
Initialize:

minSoFar is set to the first price (day 0)

maxProfit starts at 0 (worst case scenario)

Iterate through each price:

For each day's price arr[i]:

Update minSoFar to be the minimum between the current minSoFar and today's price

Calculate potential profit if we sold today (today's price - minSoFar)

Update maxProfit if this potential profit is greater than the current maxProfit

Return:

After processing all days, return the maxProfit found
example:For input [7,1,5,3,6,4]:
Day 0: price=7, min=7, profit=0
Day 1: price=1, min=1, profit=0
Day 2: price=5, min=1, profit=4
Day 3: price=3, min=1, profit=2
Day 4: price=6, min=1, profit=5
Day 5: price=4, min=1, profit=3
final max profit is 5
